## About UI and UX implementation

Since the foreign tourist can only have an information for Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, or Nagoya, I output these cities name and dummy details into a card.
The city card links for the city's current weather and the foreign tourist can search for the places to go.
